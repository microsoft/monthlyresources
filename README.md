JULY RESOURCES FOR DEVELOPERS
# Cloud Native Apps 

:wave: **Hi everyone** – welcome to the July updates to our Developer Resources repository. This month we’re featuring **what’s new and what’s next about Cloud Native Apps**. 

Among several exciting announcements at Microsoft Build 2021, we announced the preview capabilities in Azure application services that let you build cloud-native apps that run anywhere. With these capabilities, you can extend your cloud-native apps to on-premises environments, edge locations, and even other public clouds - you can read the blog and watch the session. In addition, we bring you other videos and tutorials from our SMEs on Azure Red Hat OpenShift, Kubernetes, and OpenSource. 

We hope that these resources will help you innovate and address the real-world needs of your organizations. Watch us and star us for our latest repository versions.
